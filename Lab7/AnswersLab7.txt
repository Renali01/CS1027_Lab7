Answers for Lab 7
1. Why is the compilation error produced in the statement where method check is invoked? Is this an example of a checked exception or an 
unchecked exception?
This error was produced because it requires a "throws Exception" declaration or a try-catch block.
This example is a checked exception because the error was caught at compile time, not run time.

2. Why does ExceptionExample2 crash?
NullPointerException on line 20

3. Which exception is thrown: and exception of type NullPointerException or an exception of type Exception?
NullPointerException is thrown

4. Why does the compiler give a compilation error when swapping the catch statements?
NullPointerException is a child class of Exception, so if catch (Exception e) is placed before catch (NullPointerException e), then any 
exception that would have been caught by NullPointerException e would be first caught by Exception e, rendering the catch block with NullPointerException
as pointless.

5. Why is only the word "null" printed when running the program?
In this case, the virtual machine created the standard message when Exception e is caught. The standard message is simply "null"

6. What exception is thrown by ExceptionExample10? Is this a checked exception or an unchecked exception?
Exception NumberFormatException is thrown. This is unchecked  exception because it was caught at runtime, not compilation time.
